# Table Partitioning Strategy for part_info

## Why Partitioning Will Help

1. **Query Performance**: Queries for high ID ranges (4.3M+) will only scan the relevant partition, not the entire table
2. **Maintenance**: VACUUM, ANALYZE, and REINDEX operations run faster on smaller partitions
3. **Parallel Processing**: PostgreSQL can scan multiple partitions in parallel
4. **Easier Data Management**: Can drop old partitions, archive data, or move to different storage

## Recommended Partitioning Strategy

Based on your data distribution and query patterns:

### Option 1: Range Partitioning by ID (Recommended)
```sql
-- Partition boundaries based on your data:
Partition 1: IDs 1 - 500,000 (most active, frequently queried)
Partition 2: IDs 500,001 - 1,000,000 
Partition 3: IDs 1,000,001 - 2,000,000
Partition 4: IDs 2,000,001 - 3,000,000
Partition 5: IDs 3,000,001 - 4,000,000 (sparse data)
Partition 6: IDs 4,000,001 - 5,000,000 (sparse data, timeouts happening here)
Partition 7: IDs 5,000,001 - 10,000,000 (very sparse)
Partition 8: IDs 10,000,001 - 100,000,000 (mostly empty)
```

### Benefits:
- Queries for IDs 4.3M-4.4M will only scan partition 6 (much smaller than full table)
- Can add indexes optimized for each partition's data distribution
- Can set different storage parameters for sparse partitions

## Performance Improvements Expected

1. **Current**: Scanning entire table for high IDs = slow
2. **After Partitioning**: Scanning only relevant partition = 10-100x faster

## Alternative Approaches

### Option 2: Separate Tables by Data Density
```sql
-- Active parts table (IDs < 3M with good data)
CREATE TABLE part_info_active AS 
SELECT * FROM part_info WHERE id < 3000000;

-- Sparse parts table (IDs >= 3M with sparse data)  
CREATE TABLE part_info_sparse AS
SELECT * FROM part_info WHERE id >= 3000000;

-- Create a view to maintain compatibility
CREATE VIEW part_info AS
SELECT * FROM part_info_active
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM part_info_sparse;
```

### Option 3: Archive Old/Sparse Data
Move high ID ranges to a separate archive table and only query when needed.

## Recommendation

Go with **Option 1 (Range Partitioning)** because:
- Native PostgreSQL feature with good optimizer support
- Transparent to your application (no code changes needed)
- Easy to maintain and extend
- Best performance improvement for your use case
